Interactive Sunburst Chart using D3.js

This project is an interactive data visualization built using **D3.js** that represents hierarchical data through a **Sunburst chart**. The visualization allows users to explore data by clicking on different segments and understanding relationships between categories and sub-categories in a simple and intuitive way.

##  Features

* Interactive **Sunburst chart** for hierarchical data visualization
* Click-to-zoom functionality for deeper exploration
* Smooth zoom-in and zoom-out transitions
* Tooltips for displaying additional information
* Clean and beginner-friendly user interface

##  Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* D3.js

##  Implementation Details

* **Updating Values:**
  Values are updated directly in the hierarchical data file. The Sunburst chart automatically recalculates and adjusts segment sizes using D3.js without modifying the core visualization logic.

* **Adding New Categories:**
  New categories or sub-categories can be added by extending the hierarchical data structure with a name and value. The chart dynamically reflects these changes, demonstrating scalability.

* **Zoom In & Zoom Out:**
  Clicking on a Sunburst segment zooms into that level for detailed exploration, while clicking on higher-level segments or the centre allows users to zoom out. Smooth transitions improve usability and visual clarity.
